dragonfly-modules
=================
Contains modules I have developed or extended.

They are mostly used for code/markup navigation and editing.<br>
I use them with notepad++, but they'll probably work in most text editors.

This is a working code base, and it's messy, but I'll try to keep it updated regularly.

If you are getting unknown keyword errors on default, move 'default="whatever"'<br>
from where it's at in 'extras = []' to a new defaults section.<br>
I'm using development versions of dragonfly/natlink and I'm not sure when they added support for that syntax.
